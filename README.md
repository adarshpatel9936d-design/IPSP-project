Number Theory Toolkit

This is a simple Python project that runs in the terminal. It provides a menu to perform several common number theory calculations.

How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

Save both main_terminal.py and number_theory_logic.py in the same folder.

Open your terminal (like Command Prompt or PowerShell).

Go to the folder where you saved the files.

Type the following command and press Enter:

python main_terminal.py


A menu will appear. Type the number for the calculation you want to do and press Enter.
